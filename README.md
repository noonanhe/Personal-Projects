# Personal-Projects
This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on outside of school/research. They represent my interests and skills that I have tried to develop outside of the classroom.

### React Tic-Tac-Toe App
After completing my sophomore coursework, I decided that I wanted to learn more about JavaScript, Web Development, and User Interfaces/Applications. Because of a position I had recently applied to I decided to start this new knowledge quest by becoming more familiar with React. React has a learning tutorial that teaches you about the core concepts behind this JavaScript libarary in a hands on way through developing an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe app. The tutorial can be found here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html I walked myself through this tutorial, taking notes along the way to cement the fundamentals in my head. Download and open `tic-tac-index.html` to see a working version of the app.


### Year Summary.Rmd
One of my non-school interests is personal finance. I wanted to become more responsible when it came to my finances. The first step in doing so is to know exactly where you money is going and have an accurate picture of your spending habits. I decided to use the R skills I learned in school to help me gain an understanding of my financial situation. Here I have only included the 2020 year analysis as it now stands (5/14/2020). I have a more detailed report on each month but did not feel comfortable making it public. I chose to also not include the HTML documents this script produces due to privacy concerns.
